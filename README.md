# Network Analysis
* Network analysis has a large variety of applications you can try your hand at including social structure analysis, fraud detection and more.
In this playbook you will analyze the structure of graphs using the NetworkX package. You will use the popular Zachary's karateclub dataset (source).
In the first step of this template, you will load the data, which is in a matrix format, into a NetworkX graph. Afterwards, you will explore the network and derive insights from it in step 2 and 3. Finally, you will visualize these insights in step 4.

* The data should be in matrix format. E.g: where every element is seperated by a comma in a csv file. This network is symmetric and would indicate that person 1 and 2 are connected, so are person 1 and 5, and so on. We will load the very well-known Zachary's karateclub dataset. This dataset is also symmetric, which means that if person 1 is connected to person 2, person 2 is also connected to person 1.

* Now that the data has been loaded in a graph correctly, we can start exploring it.
